Perfect — this is clear 👍
Below is a **clean, manager-friendly “Step 2” section** you can drop straight into your documentation. I’ve rewritten your points in **plain English**, structured, and slightly tightened so it reads professional but still very “for dummies”.

## **Step 2: Update the Excel File (Data Entry Rules)**

This step explains **exactly how to fill in the Excel file** so that the Power BI dashboard updates correctly.

⚠️ **Important:**
All updates must be done in the **existing Excel file stored in SharePoint**.
Do **not** change column names, sheet names, or file structure.

---

### **1. Fill in the Core Columns**

You are required to enter data for **all relevant columns** in each row.

* **KPIs**
  → Enter the **programme name** (example: “Cloud Transformation”, “Data Governance”)

* **Programs**
  → Enter the **overarching topic or initiative** the KPI belongs to

---

### **2. OEs in Progress (Very Important Rule)**

* Each row must contain **only ONE OE**
* If **more than one OE** is in progress:

  1. Insert a **new row**
  2. Duplicate the same **KPI** and **Program**
  3. Enter **one OE per row**

✅ One row = one OE only
🚫 Do not list multiple OEs in a single cell

---

### **3. Scope Column**

* Fill in the **Scope (Key milestone…)** column with the relevant scope or milestone
* Keep it clear and business-focused
* This is a **text field**, not a checklist

---

### **4. Dates (Important Formatting Note)**

There are **two date-related columns**:

* **Targeted Deliver Time**
* **Estimated Deliver Time**

⚠️ These columns behave like **text fields in Power BI**.

👉 **Do not format or type dates like real Excel dates**
Type them **as text exactly how you want them to appear** (e.g. “Q3 2026”, “Dec 2025”).

---

### **5. Financial & Commentary Columns**

Please complete the following where applicable:

* **Planned Budget (2026)**
* **Actual Spend**
* **Benefit**
* **Key Notes**

**Key Notes guidelines:**

* Maximum **20 words**
* Focus on key updates, risks, or blockers
* Avoid long explanations

---

### **6. Colour Column (Strict Rules)**

The **Colour** column controls the dashboard status.

You may ONLY enter one of the following values:

* **Red**
* **Amber**
* **Green**
* **Blue**
* **Grey**

✅ Case does not matter
(RED, red, Red, rEd are all acceptable)

🚫 Do not enter any other colours or words

---

### **7. Reporting Date Column (Mandatory)**

* Every row with data **must have a date**
* The date must represent the **reporting month**
* This ensures the data appears correctly when filtering by month in Power BI

🚫 Rows without a reporting date will not display correctly

---

### **8. Excel Formatting Notes**

* Font size, colour, or styling in Excel **will NOT affect Power BI**
* Avoid:

  * Merged cells
  * Manual totals
  * Extra formatting

Power BI reads **content**, not appearance.

---

### **9. Final Step**

Once all updates are complete:

1. **Save and close** the Excel file
2. Go to Power BI
3. **Refresh the Business Transformation Landing Page**

The dashboard will now reflect the updated data.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Tighten this further into a **1-page SOP**
* Add a **“Common mistakes to avoid”** box
* Rewrite it in a more **formal audit-style tone**
* Align wording exactly to your **column names**

Just tell me 👍
