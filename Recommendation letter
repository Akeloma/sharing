Draft Recommendation Letter

To Whom It May Concern,

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Roma Bhatt, who has been part of our IT Governance & Transformation team.

Roma began her journey by automating several dashboard pages using VBA in Excel. She took the initiative to improve existing manual processes, significantly reducing the time required for data preparation and formatting. Her ability to understand business logic and translate it into automation solutions was impressive from the start.

She later led the redesign of our IT Stability page, which has been in active use for the past eight months. The redesign improved clarity, structure, and usability for stakeholders. At the same time, she balanced a sustainability engagement initiative, where she helped design and execute interactive activities to encourage sustainable practices across the team.

One of her most impactful contributions was replicating and enhancing our existing IT Dashboard in Power BI. She worked closely with two developers over a seven-month period, supervising development while also contributing directly to the build when requirements intensified. The resulting dashboards — including IT Governance and IT Economics landing and detailed pages — allow executives to dynamically view historical trends, filter by operating entity, and analyse performance across different time periods. The implementation significantly reduced manual processing efforts and improved reporting efficiency.

Roma also played a key role in developing the Business & IT Transformation landing pages under our new transformation initiative. Throughout her time with us, she demonstrated strong stakeholder management skills, maturity in decision-making, and the ability to manage multiple priorities effectively.

She has shown initiative beyond her role, taking ownership of projects and ensuring delivery even under tight timelines. Her technical capability, combined with her growing leadership and coordination experience, makes her a valuable asset to any team.

I strongly recommend Roma and am confident she will continue to excel in her future endeavours.

Sincerely,
