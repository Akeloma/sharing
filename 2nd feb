Step by Step in Excel -
1. Open Decommissioning Compiled file
2. go to Date extracted column (Column BR)
3. filter out the date we want to process (lets take Mar as an example)
4. Filter out the dates from the 1st Mar - 31st Mar in Column Forecast End Date (Column N)
5. Filter out 'Completed' in Column 'Phase' (Column O)
6. Take note of the IDs (Column U)
7. Open IT Architecture excel file, filter out the same date (March)
8. Compare the ID values in IT Architecture Compiled file, Column ID (Column B)
9. count number of rows. number should reflect under respective OE, eg. TH has 2 rows, so it will display 2.

        )
    RETURN COALESCE(Result_, 0)
)
