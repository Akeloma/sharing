hi i have this table, it's a normal table in Power BI, its a normal text table, no calculations included. but i want to add this thing whereby, if i choose Jan 2026 on the calendar slicer, i will see the data from the previous month, which is Dec 2025. so i just need to see the previous month's data. The table name is Sheet1. Sheet1[Date] has a relationship with my Calendar[Date].
