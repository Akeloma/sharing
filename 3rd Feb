hi i have this table, it's a normal table in Power BI, its a normal text table, no calculations included. but i want to add this thing whereby, if i choose Jan 2026 on the calendar slicer, i will see the data from the previous month, which is Dec 2025. so i just need to see the previous month's data. The table name is Sheet1. Sheet1[Date] has a relationship with my Calendar[Date].  


Show_PreviousMonth_Rows =
VAR HasCalendarFilter =
    ISCROSSFILTERED ( 'Calendar' )  -- true when slicer filters Calendar

-- Uses whatever the slicer is currently filtering to get a reference date
VAR SelectedMaxDate =
    MAX ( 'Calendar'[Date] )

-- Previous month window (start to end)
VAR PrevMonthEnd =
    EOMONTH ( SelectedMaxDate, -1 )
VAR PrevMonthStart =
    DATE ( YEAR ( PrevMonthEnd ), MONTH ( PrevMonthEnd ), 1 )

-- Date for the current row in the table
VAR RowDate =
    MAX ( Sheet1[Date] )

RETURN
IF (
    HasCalendarFilter
        && RowDate >= PrevMonthStart
        && RowDate <= PrevMonthEnd,
    1,
    0
)
